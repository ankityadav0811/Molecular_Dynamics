# Elastic Constants Calculation for Al

This folder contains a LAMMPS script to compute the elastic stiffness tensor components (such as C11, C12, C44, etc.) for Aluminum (Al).

The script is based on a method developed by **Aidan Thompson (Sandia National Laboratories)**. It performs small positive and negative deformations along various Voigt notation components and computes the resulting stresses to determine the elastic constants.

We have used this approach to calculate the elastic constants of Al.
